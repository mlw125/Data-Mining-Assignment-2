Language: C++

Enviroment: 
I mainly ran my program in windows using the command prompt, using the command:
	start kmeans.exe k inputn.txt
With k being the k you want to use and n being the input file number.

I have also, if you prefer, included a makefile for easy compilation for linux. I have run the 
program on the school servers and it works just as well as it does on Windows.

I would like to point out that program only accepts the input files in the form of inputn.txt, anything else will
either give funny output file names or crash the program.
